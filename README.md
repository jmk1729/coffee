# coffee : Coronagraph design

## Overview

Coronagraph optimization routines accessible through a command line interface (CLI). Holds images in RAM, with image stream support (shared memory with low-latency IPC support).

Written in C, optimized for performance.

Executable launches a command line interface (CLI). Type "help" in the CLI to get started.

coffee uses the [MILK package](https://github.com/milk-org/MILK)


## Downloading and installing 


The coffee package follows the standard git clone steps and GNU build process :

	git clone https://github.com/coffee-rga/coffee
	cd coffee
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
	autoreconf -i
	./configure
	make
	make install

Note: On OS X you need to use gcc-mp-5 for openMP:

	./configure "CC=/opt/local/bin/gcc-mp-5" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/include/malloc/ -I/opt/local/include/readline" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib/"
(Replace "/opt/local/" is the location of your installed libraries. )

## Documentation

[Online documentation]( http://coffee-rga.github.io/coffee/ ) 


## Libraries

The following libraries are used:

- libtool
- automake
- readline, for reading the command line input
- ncurses-dev
- flex, for parsing the command line input
- bison, to interpret the command line input
- fftw, for performing Fourier Transforms
- gsl, for math functions and tools
- fitsio, for reading and writing FITS image files
- CUDA, CuBLAS, MAGMA for GPU acceleration (optional)

If you use NVIDIA GPUs, install cuda and magma libraries, and add "--enable-cuda and --enable-magma" options to the configure command.



## Getting Started

All functions are accessible from the command line interface (CLI). Enter the CLI and type "help" for instructions.

		./bin/coffee
